### Wireframes
The wireframes not represent the final product and not all pages have wireframes. After finishing the initial coding I switched out Bootstrap and strated using my own design and did not made any new wireframes.

### Design
I designed the whole app - no wonder I'm not a designer - and implemented it with pure CSS. Some pages does not have design, since I just used the already established style to make it.

### Game Flow Chart
The game directed by the game director. It decides what component to mount/unmount. Sub directors are the sologame and multigame which can direct most of their own part of the gameplay.
